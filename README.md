## TorchCrepeV2

My own version of [crepe](https://github.com/marl/crepe) in PyTorch, SOTA pitch tracking tool. Releasing as pip package for ease of usage.

Only `full` version of model is supported.

Similar project: https://github.com/maxrmorrison/torchcrepe

## Results

Tracked pitch nearly identical as compared to `crepe`.
